        "We are daughters of a Heavenly Father who loves us and we love Him"
        The purpose of the Young Women organization is to guide and nurture young women as they become covenant women of God, 
        as well as to help each young woman be worthy to make and keep sacred covenants and receive the ordinances and temple 
        blessings. As presidency of the organization of young women of the RedBud Valley ward, we focus on helping each 
        of the young women to fulfill this purpose through activities that we carry out and classes every Sunday.
        On this page you can find images and videos of these activities, but you can also find important information about content 
        that the Church has available for youngs and their leaders. We hope you enjoy it and can find out a little more about 
        what this organization does for each of our dear young women and what they also contribute to us.

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        As young women we must develop our talents and spiritual gifts that each of us has in order to be a better follower of 
        Jesus Christ.  In our activities we focus on 4 areas of development: Spiritual, Social, Physical and Intellectual.
        "And Jesus aincreased in bwisdom and stature, and in cfavour with God and man". Luke 2:52
        In this section we will share what we do in each of the activities that we carry out and some of the thoughts of each 
        young women of what she was able to learn in these activities.

      <h3> Leaders </h3>
      <p>
        As young women leaders we have a great responsibility and an enormous privilege to guide and assist young women at this 
        stage in their lives. The Church provides several resources that can be very useful to be able to exercise our calling 
        in the best way and provides us with what is necessary to do so. Here we can find things like instruction manuals, class 
        manuals, guides, lists, etc. which can help us magnify our calling. Each one of us is a very important link in this 
        organization and we hope to be able to give you all the help you need. As the ward presidency, we greatly value your time 
        and dedication and we thank you very much for your willingness to serve.

        One of the first things we learn in the young women is the theme, that's why I decided to put it at the beginning along 
        with the picture of the young women in the Temple summarizing the objective of the young women.
