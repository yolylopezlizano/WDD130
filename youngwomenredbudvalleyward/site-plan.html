        What is the purpose of young women?
        The purpose of the Young Women's organization is to guide and nurture young women as they become women of God's covenant, 
        as well as to help each young woman to be worthy to make and fulfill sacred covenants and to receive the ordinances and 
        blessings of the temple. We focus on helping them to fulfill this purpose.

      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        As young women we must develop our talents and spiritual gifts that each of us has in order to be a better follower of 
        Jesus Christ.  In our activities we focus on 4 areas of development: Spiritual, Social, Physical and Intellectual.
        "And Jesus aincreased in bwisdom and stature, and in cfavour with God and man". Luke 2:52

      <h3> Leaders </h3>
      <p>
        Young women's leaders have a great responsibility to guide and help young women.  
        The Church provides several resources that can be very useful to be able to exercise our calling in the best way.
